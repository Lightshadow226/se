<h1>Be Part of the Team!</h1>

<p>Sweet Elite is a game supported by volunteer artists, programmers and writers. However, because our team is pretty small, we could use some help to release the game as soon as possible.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b>****** IMPORTANT NOTES - Read before you apply******</b></p>

<p>Your work will be voluntary. This project is not in it for the money. We’re developing the game out of love for Otome Games and for the experience (and for the amazing team :P )
The project’s completion is estimated to be in 2-3 years. This is a long project, and so, we would appreciate that you apply only if you’re truly interested in order to save us some time in the recruitment process. <br><br>
I do not guarantee you a place on the team, places are limited and will be given according to both quality of the work presented and perceived interest/motivation towards the project.<br><br>
You are allowed to step out of the project at any time. I understand that it can be hard to keep up with the needs of the game and I will not mind you leaving. In fact, I deeply appreciate the help and interest, however small it may be. HOWEVER, if you do choose to leave the project, you must do so by 1) telling me before (don’t go MIA) and 2) NOT LEAKING ANYTHING FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF SWEET ELITE.
</p>

<p>To apply, contact us at <a href="mailto:SweeteliteStaff@gmail.com" target="_blank">Sweetelitestaff@gmail.com</a> and use this format for the subject line: <b>Name&nbsp;/&nbsp;JOB&nbsp;/&nbsp;Speciality</b> </p>

<p>For example:

Bob / ARTIST / Colorist</p>

<p>You may contact us directly via Tumblr messages but priority will be given to email communication due to its simplicity. To get a faster response from us, I recommend you apply by email.</p>

<p><b>Furthermore:</b>

DO NOT APPLY IF YOUR JOB ISN’T ON THE LIST BELOW. The position is filled and will stay filled until we say so. DO NOT ASK US WHEN A POSITION WILL OPEN. We will not tell you. If positions open, we will make announcements regarding them. DO NOT SEND US QUESTIONS ABOUT APPLICATIONS OR VOLUNTEER TO APPLY ON ANON. Anon messages about recruitment will be deleted.
