<h2>MANAGEMENT / WRITING</h2>

<b>Serena - Project Leader, Business Strategist & Main Writer</b><br>

My name is Serena and I am a huge nerd fan of otome games! It’s always been one of my dreams to make my own. I started this project because I want to revolutionize the genre, give the players an alternative to cliché tropes and characters and repetitive storylines. Sweet Elite is unique, and so is the team behind it ( I looooooove them).When I’m not working on Sweet Elite, I am wrecking my body and soul to complete my business degree, writing as a passion and a hobby, learning how to code, sleeping, and dreaming of success. <br>

My job in the project is to basically coordinate the development, plan marketing strategies, manage questions and recruitment opportunities from players and potential players, fulfill the needs of my team as much as possible and, the most exciting part…write up the story of Sweet Elite!<br>

Some of you may know me as <a href="http://mcldrabblesforyou.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">mcldrabblesforyou</a> in the My Candy Love fandom, an otome game that is one of my favorites.<br>

Thank you so much for your interest in Sweet Elite, and I hope to see you soon at Arlington Academy! :)

<h2>WRITING</h2>

<p><b>Mae - Co-Writer</b><br>

Mae here~! Some of you may know me as Dea from my blog <a href="http://d-e-a-m-a-r-o.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">d-e-a-m-a-r-o</a>, but for those who don’t: Hello! As the co-writer of Sweet Elite, I’m in charge of helping Serena write the episodes for the game. This can mean adding an idea here or there, or writing full episodes for Serena to go over later and change whatever she wants to change. Basically, I have a lot of freedom and I intend to take advantage of it OwO
<br>
So, a little bit about me~ I’m an 18 year old girl, who loves video games (specifically PC ones), sour candies, writing and drawing. Someday I hope to write a whole series of books revolving around Deamaro’s (My main OC) world, but for now I’m just jotting down all of my ideas into a tiny notebook that I carry around with me, and trying to get as much writing practice as I can ^.^
<br>
I’m gonna stop now, because I tend to ramble and this was supposed to be short. I can’t tell you guys how excited I am to be here as part of such a huge project. This is something amazing and it makes me giddy to think about the years to come</p>

<p><b>Shea - Brainstormer</b><br>

Hey! I’m Shea, as some of you know by my Tumblr <a href="http://shea-gardienne.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">shea-gardienne</a> I’ve been a fan of visual novel games for a long time and joined this project to finally be able to create one! My job is mostly to come up with ideas for designing the game, its elements, and the story among many other things. I also humor everyone with horrible jokes (heh). I’ve always wanted to learn illustration and game design and I’m very happy to be with this talented team and learn from this experience!</p>


<h2>ARTISTS</h2>

<p><b>Cecile - Sprite Artist/Colorist/Lineartist</b><br> 

“Hi I’m Cecile I’m a sexy beast and my sh*t is da bomb. I work at the speed of light and produce the kind of quality content you want to see on your dash.”<br>

(Note from Serena: Cecile is currently too busy to write up a bio due to school so I decided to write one up that is 100% accurate about her.)

No but for real. Check her out, she’s amazing and I’m insanely happy to have her on the team: <a href="http://israphael-x.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">israphael-x</a>)

<h2>WEB AND GRAPHIC DESIGN</h2>

<p><b>Courtney - Graphic Designer</b><br>

Hey, I’m Courtney the Graphic/Web designer for Sweet Elite. Some of you will recognize my snarkiness from my deactivated blog ask-castiel-mcl, but I have since started a fresh blog <a href="http://mopeyzoolion-se.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">mopeyzoolion-se</a> where you can come talk to me. (I haven’t had a chance to make it pretty yet, been busy with the game, lol) Please, I mean it I’m lonely over there, aha.<br>
 
I have been waiting for a project like this to get under way for a few years now so I am extremely excited to be apart of this team. In terms of my qualifications for this game; I have worked as a graphic Designer in a Print Shop for 6 years. A year ago made the move to working for a major retailer as a Digital Production Artist. Producing landing pages, emails, and banners for the e-commerce site. I am self taught in HTML5, CSS3 and currently learning PHP and MySQL to help in the development of the game mechanics.<br>

If you have any questions about anything fire me off an ask or message on my new blog! :)</p>
