            <h1>Join the Team</h1>

            <p>Sweet Elite is a game supported by volunteer artists, programmers and writers. However, because our team is pretty small, we could use some help to release the game as soon as possible.</p><br>

            <h2>Benefits of Working for Sweet Elite</h2>
                <li>We listen to every staff member’s input. If you have an idea when it comes to the story or character design, you can help shape Sweet Elite!</li>

                <li>You get to have experience on working on a long-term development project.</li><br>

            <h2>Before you Apply</h2>
                <li>The work is voluntary and not for monetary compensation.</li>
                <li>The project’s estimated completion is in 2-3 years. Thus, you should only apply if you are able and willing to commit to such a long project.</li>

                <li>You have the right to step out of the project at any time, but you MUST tell the project manager and must not leak any information.</li><br>
