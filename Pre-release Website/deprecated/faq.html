<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>

<br><h1>GENERAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GAME AND THE PROJECT</h1></br>

<li><b><b>“I am super excited for the release! When is the game coming out?”</b></b><br>
Thanks for being so excited! Game development is a very unpredictable process. Things usually don’t go exactly as planned. However, due to the part-time nature of Sweet Elite, we’re estimating the full release of the game in about 1 to 3 years.</li>

<li><b>Are you going to release a demo? When is it going to be out?</b><br>
Yes we are! The demo will be playable on our website and is being coded right now. The expected release is in several months.
<br>THE DEMO IS NOT RELEASED YET. To find out more about the demo's progress, <a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/149473664683/about-sweet-elites-demo-progress">Click here.</a> </br></li>


<li><b>Are you guys going to release all the chapters of the story upon the demo release?</b><br>
No. Each chapter takes a lot of time to prepare, and considering there is 50 chapters planned, it would be extremely unrealistic. The demo will contain Chapters 0, 1 and 2. For a more in-depth explanation, <a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/147671177338/i-have-a-question-are-you-guys-going-to-have-all#notes">Click here.</a>  </li>


<li><b>I want to help you guys by donating. How can I do that? </b><br>
We don’t accept money right now. Later, however, we will be launching a Kickstarter campaign to help us fund stuff we need for the game. Save up your money for that and we’ll send you some rewards in exchange!</li>

<li><b>Will there be a forum for player? </b><br>
No. <a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/147124172593/is-there-gonna-be-a-forum-for-the-players#notes">Click here to find out why.</a>  </li>

<li><b>Will there be shops? A city map? </b><br>
Yes! But we’re not going to answer many questions about those because we don’t want to spoil their content </li>

<li><b>What about mini-games? </b><br>
There will be mini-games! But again, since they have a specific purpose, we will not reveal anything about them until they are ready.  </li>

<li><b>On which platform is Sweet Elite going to be? Is it going to be a downloadable game or a browser?</b><br>
Sweet Elite is going to be a browser game. </li>

<li><b>Are you guys going to release a mobile app?</b><br>
Only in the very far future when the browser game is sufficiently established would be consider it.</li>

<li><b>Will this game be 18+ ?</b><br>
No. We are aiming to keep this game around 14+. No sex scenes or extreme gore/violence will be included.</li>


<li><b>Will we be able to create multiple accounts?</b><br>
If you create multiple accounts using different email addresses, it will be fine. We don’t mind you having multiple accounts. </li>

<li><b>Will the game be available in multiple languages? Will you need translators?</b><br>
We’re planning on releasing versions of the game in other languages but that’s a very long-term goal. Our focus is currently to finish the English version first. We cannot say whether or not we’ll need translators. If we do, we will announce it when it’s time. </li>

<li><b>Will there be a friend system? Will I be able to friend other players?</b><br>
Ideally yes. But no specific mechanic has been thought through yet. Our focus is the actual GAME. Not those features. These will come later. </li>

<li><b>Will there be a system like the Action Points? How will that work?</b><br>
You will have an energy system that you use to get through the story of the game. We have most of the mechanics down but we don’t want to reveal much. We want you to have the surprise when you play the game :)</li>

<li><b>Will we get end-of-episode illustrations? Will we see our Scholar in those?</b><br>
Yes!</li>

<li><b>Are you guys going to include music and/or sound effects in the game?</b><br>
Music and sound effects are low priority right now, but if we do get the resources and skills to implement those, we will definitely do it! </li>

<li><b>How far are you guys in the process of creating the game?</b><br>
We won’t answer to questions like this if you send us a message. The progress reports are here for that and I write some up a couple of times per month. Keep an eye out for them!</li>

<li><b>Are you guys planning on releasing merchandise I can buy? </b><br>
Yes! We’re in the process of planning this. The merchandise will be most likely unvealed during our Kickstarter campaign.</li>

<li><b>What Programs do you guys use to make the game?</b><br>
Artists use Paint Tool Sai. I use Visual Studio Code to code the demo. Courtney uses the Adobe Creative Suite. As a team, we all use Google Drive to share files. We do not use any visual novel maker program such as Ren'py. Everything is made from scratch. </li>

<li><b>Can I make a Sweet Elite fan blog? Can I post my walkthroughs and guides of the episodes?</b><br>
Of course you can! This however doesn’t give you the permission to purposely spoil other players, leak unpublished stuff, steal our art or go through our code. We WILL find you. </li>

<li><b>Who is the Staff's favorite character?</b><br>
We can't choose! They're all our babies</li>



<br><h1>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OFFICIAL STUDENT ID CARDS</h1></br>

<li><b>What are the student ID's?</b><br>
<a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/147057311468/from-ameliaarlingtonarlingtonedu-to#notes">Read about them here!</a></li>

<li><b>Can I use those to make my OCs?</b><br>
Of course!</li>

<li><b>Are the student IDs going to be part of our profile page?</b><br>
That's the plan!</li>

<br><h1>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE UNIFORM/DRESS CODE</h1></br>

<li><b>Will you make a non-binary option for the uniform? What about non-binary date outfits?</b><br>
<a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/146581957998/about-the-uniforms-non-binary-clothing-options">See this post for details!</a></li>

<br><h1>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT AND THE BADGES</h1></br>

<li><b>What are departments? What are department badges?</b><br>
As a student at Arlington Academy, your Scholar can choose between seven specializations offered to study in. Once they choose, they will be given a badge corresponding to their chosen department.<a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/144147648737/from-ameliaarlingtonarlingtonedu-to#notes">See this post for an overview of the department and to find out how you can get your own badge!</a> </li>

<li><b>Will the department I choose affect the routes I can take for the character I want?</b><br>
No. You can choose any department and this will have no effect on the story and on which character you will be allowed to pursue. You can romance anybody you want regardless of chosen department. </li>

<li><b>What is included in each department? Where does (insert thing here) fit in?</b><br>
<a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/145279114103/the-arlington-academy-departments-faq#notes">See this post for the list!</a> If you don’t see what you want in this list, <a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/145815292883/about-arlington-academy#notes">that one will most likely explain why it wasn’t included. </a> </li>

<li><b>Can you choose more than one department?</b><br>
No. It’s not worth the extra effort we would have to put into the coding and writing. </li>

<li><b>Can my Scholar choose a department they’re not skilled in?</b><br>
No. Your scholar is at Arlington because they excel in their fields. They will be written by Mae and Serena as being very good in their specialization. </li>


<br><h1>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INFINITY METER</h1></br>

<li><b>What is an “Infinity Meter”?</b><br>
The Infinity Meter is Sweet Elite’s version of the “love meter” that shows your affinity with a certain character that is present in the majority of Otome games. Unlike other meters though, the Infinity Meter is designed to showcase both your friendships and romances with each character!</li>

<li><b>Why is it called the Infinity Meter?</b><br>
Because why not? :)</li>

<li><b>How does the Infinity Meter work?</b><br>
We’ve made <a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/146021399493/sweet-elites-infinity-meter#notes"> this post going into the full details of the mechanics!</a> If you’re still confused about that, please MESSAGE US DIRECTLY. Do NOT send us an anonymous message, it will be deleted. </li>

<li><b>Can I raise my romance Infinity points with more than one character?</b><br>
Of course you can!</li>

<li><b>How will I know when to choose a frienship or romance option?</b><br>
<a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/146904590193/hi-ive-seen-that-there-will-be-friendship-and#notes">See this pretty neat explanation by Courtney!</a></li>


<br><h1>QUESTIONS ABOUT SCHOLAR/THE PLAYER CHARACTER</h1></br>

<li><b>What is a “Scholar”?</b><br>
Scholar is the name we give to the playable character. </li>

<li><b>Can you choose the muscle size/height/breast size/body type of Scholar? Will those features be seen in the end-of-episode illustrations? </b><br>
This will depend entirely on the artists and the amount of work they want to take on. Adding those options means adding way more work, and we’re all only part time working on the game. Those features will most likely not be implemented. </li>

<li><b>What are the features that will be customizable on Scholar?</b><br>
Here are the features that have an almost 100% guarantee to be customizable: Hair color, Hairstyle, Eye Color, Skin Color and Facial Expression (though these will not appear in illustrations)</li>

<li><b>What hair styles/hair colors/eye colors/skin colors/other features of Scholars will be available?</b><br>
We will reveal those features only when they are ready. Stop asking us questions related to those. </li>


<li><b>But are we going to be able to customize (insert part of character here) on Scholar?</b><br>
Again, we will reveal all of this when it’s ready. We appreciate your patience. </li>


<li><b>Are we going to be able to buy clothes and accessories for Scholar?</b><br>
Yes!</li>

<li><b>I want unnatural hair colours. Will we be able to buy wigs for our Scholar?</b><br>
Yes!</li>

<li><b>What kind of personality will Scholar have? How will they act? Will their personality be kind of “default” or do we get to choose certain personality traits?</b><br>
Arlington Academy is a school for the most talented, intelligent, skilled teenagers of the world. If Scholar got into the school, it means they’re exactly that. Scholar is smart and strong. However, the pressure is high on Scholar because of the nature of the school. Thus, their personality is highly determined by the player’s choices as to how they will react to the events and pressures involving Arlington Academy. </li>

<li><b>Will you be allowed to chose the ethnicity and nationality of Scholar?</b><br>
Maybe. If we do implement this feature, it has to have some sort of purpose. So far, we’re leaning towards a no. </li>

<li><b>Why is Scholar a student at Arlington Academy? Why are they moving there?</b><br>
Scholar is a scholarship student at Arlington Academy and is starting a new year there. Tuition fees are astronomically high at AA because a diploma from there basically boosts your career as you get into the job market. Scholarships are extremely rare, so Scholar and her family would have to be crazy to turn down the opportunity.</li>

<li><b>Will Scholar live in a dorm? Will they have a roommate?</b><br>
Scholar lives in their own dorms. We initially planned a “personality test” that would determine which character Scholar would end up having as a roommate. However, that idea was scrapped because we changed the story a little. So no, Scholar is lonely in their dorm :’) However, if everything goes as planned, we have a little surprise for you concerning the dorms!</li>

<li><b>Will you be able to choose how your scholar’s parents are? Like same-sex couple, their names, their marital status, etc. </b><br>
<a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/tagged/teaser">Opps thats a SPOILER.</a> </li>

<li><b>Does Scholar have any siblings?</b><br>
No. Scholar is an only child.</li>

<li><b>Will Scholar be the default name of your character or will you be able to choose?</b><br>
For now, we are planning to have both your username and your in-game name the same. However, we may implement a feature allowing you to make your in-game name different from your username (because characters calling you “mew-mew-lover-24” is kind of weird.) We’ll have to see what we can do at later stages of development. One thing’s for sure, same usernames (not in-game names) will not be allowed. </li>

<h1>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE GAME’S STORY</h1>

<li><b>In Arlington Academy, will there be a mandatory uniform?</b><br>
While during school hours, all students will be required to wear the official school uniform. After school hours, wearing the uniform will be optional to students who just want to chill on campus…and go on dates!</li>

<li><b>In Sweet Elite, will the seasons change? Will some characters not come to school during December because they could get sick, or they don’t like the cold? Will the characters in the game have different outfits or extra accessories or less accessories because it’s cold or hot out?</b><br>
Sweet Elite is currently planned to spawn across dozens of episodes, with a very continuous story. So yes, seasons will change. Beyond that though, is spoiler territory :)</li>

<li><b>Where is Arlington Academy located?</b><br>
The location isn’t decided yet, but it will most likely be on the Northern East Coast of the United States. We’re leaning towards a metropolitan area. 
</li>

<li><b>Will you include a (Insert Characteristic Here) character? (i.e. gay, chubby, POC)</b><br>
Our characters are still being designed, so there is no way of knowing already what they will be. Our focus when creating characters is the personality first, and THEN adding those characteristics. The answer to your question is maybe, you will see when we reveal them. 
</li>

<li><b>Will you make a (Insert thing here) episode? (beach, prom, etc.)</b><br>
Again, stop asking us, this is spoiler territory and we will not answer it. 
</li>

<h1>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DATABLE CHARACTERS</h1>

<li><b>Will we be able to date any of the main 10 character, regardless of their gender?</b>
Yes. Your scholar will be able to date all main 10 characters, which includes 5 guys and 5 girls. This is regardless of any of their genders. </li>

<li><b>Are we allowed to pitch in ideas for datable characters?</b><br>
No. We've completed most of their designs and are going towards their final versions. 10 datable characters is enough work as it is.
</li>

<li><b>Will the datable character be Scholar’s age, or will there be older dating options?</b><br>
Scholar will be of high school age. We don’t want to give them a particular age for now. 
The main 10 datable characters will be Scholar’s age and in the same year as them. For now, no older options are planned. 
Furthermore, since Scholar’s character will be a high school student, and thus, a minor, we will not be offering a datable teacher. </li>
