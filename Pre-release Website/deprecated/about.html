<h1>About Sweet Elite</h1>

<p><em>“In a school filled with rich, beautiful and insanely talented students, nothing could go wrong….could it? Arlington Academy has its secrets. Secrets it doesn’t want to expose. Will you be able to find out about the truth? Or will the pressure be too much for you to handle? It’s up to you!”</em></p>

<p>Sweet elite is an upcoming Otome game following the adventures of the students of Arlington Academy, a prestigious high school only accessible to the best of the best of teenagers in their respective fields.</p> 

<p>The player’s character, the Scholar, is a scholarship student and makes a series of major choices, affecting both their destiny and those of the people around them.</p>

<p>The Scholar will have to chose their academic specialization among those offered at Arlington:

<ul class="contentbulleted_list">

<li>Pure and Applied Sciences</li>

<p>This game is designed to fix many problems and controversial issues we’ve seen in the community, including: 
<ul class="contentbulleted_list">
<li><b>No Same-sex Dating:</b> Girl players want to date girl characters and boy players want to date boy characters. Most games do not offer an LGTBQ branch of the storyline.</li>
<li><b>Lack of Diversity:</b> Players often have to settle with a playable character that has no skin color/race options. Furthermore, characters in-game (datable or not) are rarely PoC and many of you would like a more diverse cast.</li>
<li><b>Lack of variety & cliché characters and stories:</b> Many players would like more dialogue options as well as choices that truly make a difference in the end. </li></ul>
Sweet Elite distinguishes itself from other games of the genre by offering a ethnically diverse cast of characters, dating and friendship options for characters of both genders and a variety of story and dialogue options.

<h1>MEET THE CHARACTERS </h1>

<p><h1>Tadashi</h1>

Tadashi is the current Student Body President of Arlington Academy. Having the highest GPA of the school, an estimated IQ of 160, being a star student and a Jack of all trades, Tadashi doesn’t have time for any crap…and that means it will be very hard for your Scholar to get to know him. You’ll have to be sharp, organized and future-oriented…because the future is exactly what troubles this guy.

<p><h1>Axel</h1>

The rock star of the Academy. Literally. Axel is an internationally known teenage superstar and is usually seen touring for his new album. Cocky, sarcastic and oh-so-charming, Axel only comes to Arlington because the law requires him to get his high school diploma and he makes sure everybody is aware of his nonchalance…But this musician constantly covers up who he is. In fact, is Axel even his real name?

<p><h1>Alistair</h1>

The most promising athlete of the school, he’s on a scholarship just like your Scholar! Alistair specializes in martial arts in general, but his favorite sport is boxing, in which he dreams of making a career out of it and competing in the Olympic Games one day. Unlike most of his classmates, Alistair comes from a middle-class family that struggles with money…and he’s determined to change that. Despite the difference in social classes, Tadashi and him have been best friends for a long time.

<p><h1>Tegan</h1>

A European foreign student, Tegan specializes in Computer Science. He loves to program and spends the majority of his time in front of the computer. He also loves robotics and any kind of engineering. He has the second highest GPA of the school, beaten only by Tadashi. But despite his adorkableness and his intelligence, Tegan faces a lot of pressure from people…people who won’t believe in him and his dreams. His roommate and best friend is Tyler and he has a twin sister: Karolina.

<p><h1>Tyler</h1>

A graphic designer in the Fine Arts department and highly skilled in anything involving visuals thanks to his photographic memory, Tyler loves to be the center of attention! He is an artist from head to toe: charming, sensitive, creative…and highly critical of himself. It’s hard to constantly feel like your work isn’t good enough, especially when rejection is everywhere you look. Despite being very different, Tyler and Tegan make an incredible team…and being their friend comes with a lot of advantages!</p>

<p><i>Teaser Coming Soon!</i></p>




<p><h1>Karolina</h1>

Considered by many to be the prettiest girl in school, Karolina specializes in modelling. She’s gorgeous and fully aware of her charm. In fact, she makes sure that everybody knows that she’s the <i>hottest, coolest, most amazing girl in this whole establishment okay?! </i> She is ruthless and will do anything to get what she wants. However, despite her overachieving ways and her promising future, Karolina finds herself struggling with her image…so much that it starts affecting her mental state and health. Her best friend and “second in command” is Neha.</p>

<p><h1>Neha</h1>
An aspiring fashion designer, Neha loves making her own clothes and other’s clothes. She spends countless hours designing seasonal collections and actually sells them to the students of Arlington (at a very high price!) Her success in the school is huge and she’s almost always sold out…but she’s using that success to hide her secret…a secret she believes will destroy her. She uses Karolina as her main model and is Axel’s official stylist for his concerts and photoshoots. Rather reserved and cold, Neha can however be surprisingly nice…whenever Karolina isn’t around.</p>

<p><h1>Raquel</h1>

Raquel is passionate, borderline obsessed about soccer! A promising athlete in the athletics department, she’s energetic, ambitious and has no time for any crap. Despite being the most direct and honest student in Arlington, she can’t help but have a secret too…a secret she tries really hard to hide from her family. Raquel is always in it for the win, and that’s because she simply cannot afford to lose.
