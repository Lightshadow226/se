                    <li>
                        <b>When is the game coming out? I'm super excited about the release!</b>
                        <p>Game development is a very unpredictable process. Things usually don’t go exactly as planned. However, due to the part-time nature of Sweet Elite, we’re estimating the full release of the game in about 1 to 2 years.</p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Are you going to release a demo? When is it going to be out?</b></br>
                        <p>Yes we are! The demo will be playable on our website and is being coded right now. The expected release is in several months. THE DEMO IS NOT YET RELEASED!</p><br>

                    <li>
                        <b>Will there be a forum for the players on the website?</b></br>
                        <p>No. <a href="http://sweetelite-staff.tumblr.com/post/147124172593/is-there-gonna-be-a-forum-for-the-players#notes">Click here to find out why.</a></p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Are you guys going to release all the chapters of the story upon the demo release?</b></br>
                        <p>No. Each chapter in itself takes a lot of time to prepare (writing, illustrating, coding, beta tests, etc.), and considering there is 50 chapters planned, it would be extremely unrealistic. The demo will contain Chapters 0, 1 and 2.</p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>What will be the frequency of the release of the chapters? Every two weeks? Two months?</b></br>
                        <p>We don’t have any fixed schedule planned for chapter releases. We'll release them when they are ready, and we do everything we can to minimize the wait time.</p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Will there be shops? A city map? </b></br>
                        <p>Yes! But we’re not going to answer many questions about those because we don’t want to spoil their content.</p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>What about mini-games?</b></br>
                        <p>There will be mini-games! But again, since they have a specific purpose, we will not reveal anything about them until they are ready.</p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>On which platform is Sweet Elite going to be? Is it going to be a downloadable game or a browser?</b></br>
                        <p>Sweet Elite is going to be a browser game.</p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Are you guys going to release a mobile app?</b></br>
                        <p>Only in the very far future when the browser game is sufficiently established would start development for mobile.</p><br>
                    </li>

                     <li>
                        <b>Will we be able to create multiple accounts?</b></br>
                        <p>If you create multiple accounts using different email addresses, it will be fine. We don’t mind you having multiple accounts.</p><br>
                    </li>

                     <li>
                        <b>Will this game be 18+ ?</b></br>
                        <p>No. We are aiming to keep this game around 14+. No sex scenes or extreme gore/violence will be included.</p><br>
                    </li>


                     <li>
                        <b>Will the game be available in multiple languages? Will you need translators?</b></br>
                        <p>We’re planning on releasing versions of the game in other languages but that’s a <i>very</i> long-term goal. Our focus is currently to finish the English version first. We cannot say whether or not we’ll need translators. If we do, we will announce it when it’s time. Do <i>NOT</i> ask us if we want help to translate the game before we make that announcement.</p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Will you need voice actors?</b></br>
                        <p>No, we will not be needing voice actors for now. Voicing the characters might happen in the future once we’ve already launched.</p><br>
                    </li>                   

                     <li>
                        <b>But can I still be part of the Staff if you need me?</b></br>
                        <p>Of course! <i>But only apply if your job is listed on the Join Us page.</i>We delete any message that we suspect is from someone who hasn’t read the rules.</p><br>
                    </li>

                     <li>
                        <b>Will there be a friend system? Will I be able to friend other players?</b></br>
                        <p>Ideally yes. But no specific mechanic has been thought through yet. Our focus is the actual game. Not those features. These will come later.</p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Will there be a system like the Action Points? How will that work?</b></br>
                        <p>You will have an energy system that you use to get through the story of the game. We have most of the mechanics down but we don’t want to reveal much. We want you to have the surprise when you play the game!</p><br>
                    </li>

                     <li>
                        <b>Will we get end-of-episode illustrations? Will we see our Scholar in those?</b></br>
                        <p>Yes and yes!</p><br>
                    </li>

                     <li>
                        <b>Are you guys going to include music and/or sound effects in the game?</b></br>
                        <p>Music and sound effects are low priority right now, but if we do get the resources and skills to implement those, we will definitely do it! If you want to apply as a musician, please contact us!</p><br>
                    </li>

                     <li>
                        <b>How far are you guys in the process of creating the game?</b></br>
                        <p>We won’t answer to questions like this if you send us a message. The progress reports are here for that and I write some up a couple of times per month. Keep an eye out for them!</p><br>
                    </li>

                     <li>
                        <b>Are you guys planning on releasing merchandise I can buy? </b></br>
                        <p>Yes! We’re in the process of planning this.</p><br>
                    </li>

                      <li>
                        <b>What Programs do you guys use to make the game?</b></br>
                        <p>Artists use Paint Tool Sai. I use Visual Studio Code to code the demo and photoshop for various works. As a team, we all use Google Drive to share files. We do not use any visual novel maker program such as Ren'py. Everything is made from scratch.</p><br>
                    </li> 

                    <li>
                        <b>Can I make a Sweet Elite fan blog? Can I post my walkthroughs and guides of the episodes?</b></br>
                        <p>Of course you can! This however doesn’t give you the permission to purposely spoil other players, leak unpublished stuff, steal our art or go through our code. We WILL find you. </p><br>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Who is the Staff’s favorite character?</b></br>
                        <p>We can’t choose! They’re all our babies.</p><br>
                    </li>  

                    <li>
                        <b>Are you guys associated to a company?</b></br>
                        <p>We have already incorporated! The company is called Dulcet Games Inc. and is registered under the Canadian federal government. Sweet Elite, along with all the copyrights associated with the game belongs to it.</p><br>
                    </li>  

                    <li>
                        <b>How old are the staff members?</b></br>
                        <p>The average age is around 21-22 years old. I will not reveal our individual ages.</p><br>
                    </li>  
                                         
                    <li>
                        <b>I want to help you guys by donating. How can I do that? </b></br>
                        <p>You're awesome for wanting to help us, but we're not accepting money right now. Later, however, we will offer merchandise and possibly a Kickstarter campaign filled with rewards to help us fund the game. Save your money for those!</p><br>

                        <b>In Arlington Academy, will there be a mandatory uniform?</b></br>
                        <p>While during school hours, all students will be required to wear the official school uniform. After school hours, wearing the uniform will be optional to students who just want to chill on campus…and go on dates!</p><br>
                    </li>  

                    <li>
                        <b>In Sweet Elite, will the seasons change? Will some characters not come to school during December because they could get sick, or they don’t like the cold? Will the characters in the game have different outfits or extra accessories or less accessories because it’s cold or hot out?</b></br>
                        <p>Sweet Elite is currently planned to spawn across dozens of episodes, with a very continuous story. So yes, seasons will change and characters will adapt to that.</p><br>
                    </li> 

                    <li>
                        <b>Where is Arlington Academy located?</b></br>
                        <p>The location isn’t decided yet, but it will most likely be on the Northern East Coast of the United States. We’re leaning towards a metropolitan area.</p><br>

                        <p>Sweet Elite’s event will take place in the near future, with the start of the timeline being marked as September 20XX.</p><br>

                        <p>Stop asking us these things. This is heavy spoiler territory and we will not be revealing anything about that yet.</p><br>

                        <b>Will you include a (Insert Characteristic Here) character? (i.e. gay, chubby, POC)</b></br>
                        <p>Our characters are still being designed, so there is no way of knowing already what they will be. Our focus when creating characters is the personality first, and THEN adding those characteristics. The answer to your question is maybe, you will see when we reveal them.</p><br>

                        <p>Yes. Your scholar will be able to date all main 10 characters, which includes 5 guys and 5 girls. This is regardless of any of their genders. </p><br>

                        <p>Scholar will be of high school age. We don’t want to give them a particular age for now. The main 10 datable characters will be Scholar’s age and in the same year as them. For now, no older options are planned.</p><br>

                        <b>What kind of personality will Scholar have? How will they act? Will their personality be kind of “default” or do we get to choose certain personality traits?</b></br>
                        <p>Arlington Academy is a school for the most talented, intelligent, skilled teenagers of the world. If Scholar got into the school, it means they’re exactly that. Scholar is smart and strong. However, the pressure is high on Scholar because of the nature of the school. Thus, their personality is highly determined by the player’s choices as to how they will react to the events and pressures involving Arlington Academy.</p><br>

                        <p>Maybe. If we do implement this feature, it has to have some sort of purpose. So far, we’re leaning towards a no.</p><br>

                        <b>Why is Scholar a student at Arlington Academy? Why are they moving there?</b></br>
                        <p>Scholar is a scholarship student at Arlington Academy and is starting a new year there. Tuition fees are astronomically high at AA because a diploma from there basically boosts your career as you get into the job market. Scholarships are extremely rare, so Scholar and her family would have to be crazy to turn down the opportunity.</p><br>

                        <b>Will our Scholar’s appearance affect our parent’s appearance? Or will the parents have a default appearance?</b></br>
                        <p>Yes and no. That’s all we’re going to say about parents.</p><br>

                        <p>For now, we are planning to have both your username and your in-game name the same. However, we may implement a feature allowing you to make your in-game name different from your username (because characters calling you “mew-mew-lover-24” is kind of weird.) We’ll have to see what we can do at later stages of development.</p><br>
