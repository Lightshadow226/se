			<h2>What is Sweet Elite?</h2>
			<p>Sweet Elite is an online dating simulation and mystery game that centers around the main character transferring into an elite boarding school made for the most intelligent, most talented teenagers in the world.</p><br>
			<p>Your child experiences the story in “Visual Novel” style, a script written in a way to allow the player to make different choices and impact the story and their relationships with the characters as they wish. Sweet Elite also allows the player to customize their character with different clothing options.</p><br>
			<p>The aim of the game is to solve the mysteries of the school and build relationships with fellow students while experiencing a thrilling adventure at Arlington Academy.</p><br>
			<p>The game can be played entirely for free. However, we do offer options to purchase in-game credits and official merchandise in our stores.

As stated in our TERMS AND CONDITIONS, we do not allow individuals under the age of 18 years of age to purchase credits without the consent of their parent or legal guardian.</p><br>

			<h2>What age does your child have to have to play?</h2>
